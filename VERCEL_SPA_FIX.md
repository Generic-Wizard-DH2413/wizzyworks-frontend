# Vercel SPA Routing Fix

## Problem Identified

The redirect refresh hook wasn't working on Vercel deployment due to **Single Page Application (SPA) routing issues**. When users accessed URLs directly (like `/shapePicker` or `/launch`) or refreshed the page, Vercel tried to serve these as static files, which don't exist.

## Root Causes

1. **Missing Vercel SPA Configuration**: The `vercel.json` file didn't include proper routing rewrites for SPA
2. **Netlify-specific configuration**: Had a `_redirects` file meant for Netlify, not Vercel
3. **Browser API differences**: The refresh detection logic needed improvement for production environments

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated `vercel.json`
Added proper SPA routing configuration:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "framework": "vite",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

This tells Vercel to serve `index.html` for all routes, allowing React Router to handle client-side routing.

### 2. Removed Netlify `_redirects` file
Removed the incompatible `public/_redirects` file that was meant for Netlify deployment.

### 3. Improved Refresh Detection Hook
Enhanced `useRefreshRedirect.js` with:
- Better timing handling with timeout delay
- Improved fresh load detection with timestamp checking
- Enhanced logging for production debugging
- More robust fallback logic

## How It Works Now

1. **Direct URL Access**: When someone visits a URL like `yoursite.com/shapePicker`, Vercel serves `index.html`
2. **React Router Takes Over**: The client-side router determines the correct component to render
3. **Refresh Detection**: The hook detects if it's a refresh/direct navigation and redirects to home page
4. **Normal Navigation**: Programmatic navigation within the app works normally

## Testing

After deployment to Vercel:
1. ✅ Direct URL access should work (e.g., `yoursite.com/shapePicker`)
2. ✅ Page refresh should redirect to home page as intended
3. ✅ Normal navigation within the app should work
4. ✅ Browser back button prevention should function properly

## Additional Notes

- The refresh redirect hook still works as designed - it detects refreshes and redirects to the home page
- All existing functionality is preserved
- The fix is specific to deployment routing and doesn't affect local development
- Console logging is enhanced for easier debugging in production

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated code to Vercel
2. Test the deployed version with direct URL access
3. Verify refresh behavior works as expected
4. Monitor console logs for any additional issues

The main issue was infrastructure-related (Vercel routing) rather than the hook logic itself.
